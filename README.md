# üíå Mobile Wedding Invitation üíå

![demo1.gif](demo1.gif)

This project is a modern, responsive mobile wedding invitation web application built with React and TypeScript. The project provides a beautiful, interactive digital wedding invitation that can be easily customized and deployed.

Built with React 18.2.0 and TypeScript, it uses Vite for fast and convenient development environment. ESLint and Prettier are applied for code quality, and styling is handled with Emotion/styled components.

The gallery uses react-photoswipe-gallery, and the maps integration has been migrated from Naver Maps to Google Maps for international compatibility.
